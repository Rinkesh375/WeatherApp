## Daily Weather 

WeatherApp is a simple and intuitive web application built with React.js that provides users with up-to-date weather forecasts for various cities around the world. With WeatherApp, users can easily select a city from a dropdown menu and instantly view its weather forecast for the next few days.

## Features:
- City Selection: WeatherApp features a user-friendly dropdown menu where users can select their desired city from a list of available options. Cities included in the dropdown menu are Ho Chi Minh, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Tokyo, and Athens, providing users with a diverse range of locations to choose from.

- Weather Forecast: Upon selecting a city, WeatherApp dynamically fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the forecast for the selected city. The forecast includes information such as the date, temperature in Celsius, weather icon, and description for each day.

## How It Works:
- Dropdown Menu: WeatherApp utilizes a dropdown menu component to allow users to select their desired city. When users click on the dropdown menu, they are presented with a list of available cities to choose from. Upon selecting a city, the dropdown menu updates to display the selected city.

- Fetching Weather Data: When a user selects a city from the dropdown menu, WeatherApp triggers an AJAX request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the selected city's name. This request fetches the weather forecast data for the selected city, including temperature, weather icon, and description for each day.

- Displaying Weather Forecast: Once the weather data is successfully retrieved from the API, WeatherApp dynamically renders the weather forecast for the selected city. Each day's forecast is displayed as a card, featuring the date, temperature in Celsius, weather icon representing the forecasted conditions, and a brief description of the weather.
